## Remarks

### Verifying Webhook URL
* When you veriy a webhook url in the LINE Developers Console, it will fail because it sends events with invalid reply tokens. You can ignore the step. Webhook works well without verifying.

### Replying Messages in DEV Phase
* In most cases of the dev phase, reply tokens will be invalid. So, replying requests will be redirected to the console output.

### About `optionalDependencies` in `package.json`
* These dependencies are provided by "Parse Server 2.6.5", so will not be packed.
* `ejs@2.5.2` is excluded because of its vulnerabilities([1](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000228), [2](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000188)).
